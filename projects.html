						<p class='exp-title'><strong>3D Modelling using Uncalibrated Images</strong></p>
						<p class='exp-detail'>This was our final year project for my Bachelor's of Engineering. The idea is to take multiple pictures of an object from multiple positions, to create a 3D model of the object. It used a simple robot with a mobile phone mounted to take pictures, and tag pictures with required sensor information required. The features were extracted from the images then matched to reconstruct the 3D model. The motivation behind the project was to help in the preservation of rich Nepali cultural artifacts and monuments. Numerous cultural heritage sites were devastated by the massive earthquake of 2015, but a technology that can visualize these sites would assist in reconstruction.</p>

						<p class='exp-title'><strong>Treadbot</strong></p>
						<p class='exp-detail'>Tread bot was a simple robot operating on Raspberry Pi that could be controlled by hand gestures. The hand gesture recognition was trained using HAAR Features using on OpenCV. The gestures were trained using 2000 positive images and 5000 negative images. Most of the positive images were collected manually in the university while the negative samples were collected from various screenshots of the movies or random backgrounds in the classroom. If you are interested in the training dataset, please feel free to contact me. The code for the project is available <a href="https://github.com/Sandeep-Sthapit/HandGestureDetection" target="blank">here</a>.</p>

						<p class='exp-title'><strong>Robotic Resataurant</strong></p>
						<p class='exp-detail'>Robotic Restaurant is an autonomous path finding robot that uses Kinect, Lidar to create a map and navigate accordingly. The idea was to create a modern restaurant environment where customer orders food through a mobile application and robot serves the food to the right customer. It was displayed in LOCUS 2016 ( a national level exhibition/competition) and was ranked 1st place in the Industrial and Automation Competition in the same competition. My fellow project partners have expanded this project and developed an intelligent robot that is currently serving food at Naulo Restaurant in Nepal. They are also exporting some of the robots internationally. For more information check out <a href="https://paailatechnology.com/" target="blank">Paaila Technology</a>.</p>

						<p class='exp-title'><strong>Basketball Court</strong></p>
						<p class='exp-detail'>As the title suggests, this project simulates a basketball court. Being a big fan of basketball, I chose this as my computer graphics project. The project is built on C++ and is completely made from scratch except for the pixel drawing function. Most of the project relates to the creation of required geometric shapes, lighting functions and motion of the ball. The code for the project is available <a href="https://github.com/Sandeep-Sthapit/BasketBallCourt" target="blank">here</a>.</p>

						<p class='exp-title'><strong>123Go</strong></p>
						<p class='exp-detail'>123Go was part of my IT-Innovation and Entrepreneurship Project which is aimed to solve public transportation problems prevalent in Kathmandu. It makes data such as arrival times, distance and availability of local communes available to people. By using an old smartphone to provide the location of the vehicle, the project tracked the vehicle position, calculated and displayed the estimated time of arrival, and drew its route on google maps.</p>

						<p class='exp-title'><strong>nXplore</strong></p>
						<p class='exp-detail'>nXplore was the project idea for NCell AppCamp 2015 that was developed to promote tourism in Nepal. It aimed to highlight important aspects of Nepali culture, namely food, dress, dance, arts, musical instruments, and festivals. The main purpose of the application was to provide basic information regarding each item such as a brief description of the item and where it is available. It was built on the android platform.</p>
