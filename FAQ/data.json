            "Wash hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after coming home from outside, before cooking, and before eating.",
            "If water and soap are not immediately available, use alcohol-based sanitizer.",
            "Wear a mask to cover your nose and mouth when you go outside.",

            " Stay inside except for essential tasks.",
            "Keep a distance of at least 3 feet from others when you are outside, 6 feet is better.",
            "Avoid crowds, including groups of people you already know such as friends or neighbors.",
            "Avoid shaking hands, hugging, or touching when greeting people."

        },
        {
          "question": "What is physical or social distancing?",
          "answer": "To avoid catching COVID-19, WHO recommends that we keep at least 3 feet from other people. Even greater distance is better. This is to ensure that if someone is coughing or sneezing, you will be at lower risk of inhaling small droplets full of viruses. While social distancing has become the popular term for it, WHO recommends the use of the term physical distancing."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does this 3 feet distance work?  Does this mean that COVID-19 virus cannot live in air or it cannot travel more than 3 feet?",
          "answer": "The infectious dose is the amount of virus needed to establish an infection.  To be infected  there should be exposure to at least certain number of virus, below which infection is not possible . This distance reduces the chances of inhaling a lot of virus particles released when people cough, sneeze or talk which lowers the chances of getting an infection significantly. COVID-19 is spread mainly among people who are in close contact of each other, so 3 feet is a minimum. It does not mean the virus isn't infective in the air or travel more than 3 feet, but it reduces the chance of infection.  In fact, the USA recommends a distance of 6 feet, and the UK recommends 2 meters (over 6 feet), so basically, the further you are, the safer you are."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does coughing spread COVID-19?",
          "answer": "One cough can fire 3000 droplets into the air and if the person who coughed has COVID-19, then they will be firing millions of virus particles into the air. These may be inhaled by someone close by, or may land on solid surfaces that become contaminated. Watch <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/14/science/coronavirus-transmission-cough-6-feet-ar-ul.html' target='_blank'>this simulation</a> to see how far viruses can be spread by a cough. That is why it is important to cover your mouth when sneezing and coughing. Always wear a mask when you go out, and keep your distance."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is better for cleaning the hands, alcohol-based sanitizer gel or soap and water?",
          "answer": "Soap and water is better as soap dissolves the fatty outer layer of the COVID-19 virus, making the virus inactive. But you can use alcohol-based sanitizer gel during those times when soap and water are not easily available, for example, when you are outdoors or shopping for essentials."
        },
        {
          "question": "For safety precautions, apart from frequent hand washing and physical distancing what are other safety measures to be followed, at individual and household/family level?",
          "answer": "Physical distancing and frequent handwashing are key. If anyone is feeling sick, it is best to avoid sitting closely together in the same room.  If someone in your family is in home quarantine, it is best if they can use their own room and bathroom. If you have to share, make sure to clean the bathroom thoroughly with disinfectant after every use. Do not share toothbrushes, dishes and other personal items. Wear a mask whenever you have to be around each other."
        },
        {
          "question": "Will the virus spread along the surface of the road if a COVID-19 virus infected person passes by?",
          "answer": "This would be most unlikely, especially if you are more than 3 feet away. In well-ventilated areas, and outdoors, the virus particles in the air get dispersed quickly."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is being close to a COVID-19 virus patient only once enough to transfer the virus?",
          "answer": "The more people with COVID-19 whom you mix, or the more time you spend with a person with COVID-19, the more likely you will get infected. In Nepal, the cases of virus transfer observed so far have been among family members sharing the same home, or groups sharing the same living space."

        },
        {
          "question": "How long does the COVID-19 virus persist in the environment?",
          "answer": "The virus can persist in air for up to three hours but it will be dispersed in the outdoors. If you cough into your hands and touch other surfaces, then the virus may be transferred to solid surfaces. This virus can persist on stainless steel and plastics for up to 72 hours and on cardboard for up to 24 hours depending on relative humidity and temperature . It is best to clean surfaces with a disinfectant containing more than 60% alcohol or 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite."

          "answer": "Cough and fever (over 100°F / 38°C) are the most important ones. Shortness of breath is another common symptom. About 80% of people infected with COVID-19 will have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. COVID-19 symptoms tend to come on gradually and can be: sore throat, shortness of breath, headache, loss of appetite, loss of taste or smell, temporary aches and pains / muscle aches, and a runny nose."
        },
        {
          "question": "Should we go to the doctor immediately if we have a slight headache or a cough?",
          "answer": "If you suspect that you might have come into contact with someone who had COVID-19 or if you have recently returned from areas at high risk for COVID-19 and have these symptoms, please contact COVID hotlines at 1115 & 1133 (6am - 10pm) or 9851-255-834, 9851-255-837 and 9851-255-839 (8am - 8pm) for advice. You can also contact your local health worker, ward representative or other officials.</br></br>Otherwise, if you have mild symptoms like a slight headache or cough, there is no need. Take some paracetamol and drink plenty of water. Covid-19 has no treatment yet. Even in hospitals all they do is  provide symptomatic relief and try to make the infection manageable. There is no treatment of Covid19 yet. Most people are afraid of a simple common cold or sore throat and fear if they have been infected by covid19 even with out having travel history or  exposure. You need to reassure yourself that not every cold or sore throat means you are infected by covid19. You should stick to self care and manage the symptoms in any possible way . There is no treatment of covid19 infection at the moment. Unless you have very severe symptoms which can not be managed at home it is  best to self isolate yourself and manage the symptoms that can be addressed at home. Remember hospitals are a place where all sorts of people come for check up and screening. If you are not infected by  covid19 you are  more  likely to get infected in hospital while you go for check up than at home self isolating. Provided that you eat and rest properly most illnesses go away on their own. You should keep away from old people and those with medical problems. If the symptoms worsen, take actions listed above."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is incubation period?",
          "answer": "Incubation period is the time between exposure to an infection and the appearance of the first symptoms. Usually people begin symptoms 5-6 days after being infected with the virus but it can be anywhere between 2 – 14 days. However, there are also many people who have the COVID-19 virus, but show no symptoms at all. These people without symptoms, called asymptomatic carriers, can also spread the virus."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is it true that the number of viral particles that get into you affects how ill you might become?",
          "answer": "Probably. Viruses need to get into the body in large numbers to make you ill. The minimum number of virus particles that needs to get into you in order to start an infection is called an infectious dose, and the infectious dose for COVID-19 is not certain. Generally, if one or two float into you from the air that is unlikely to have any effect but if someone with COVID-19 coughs in your face you will probably breathe in and swallow millions of virus particles and get infected. Keep away from people who are coughing and crowded places.</br></br>Our body is not used to this virus, so it has to start from scratch in the race to beat it. If a large number of viruses get in, they could multiply into huge numbers before the body has enough time to respond. This could be a reason why many medical workers seem to get very ill with the virus."
        },
        {
          "question": "Suppose I get sick with COVID-19 but then I recover and do well, would I still be a risk to others that I hang out with?",
          "answer": "The first 14 days after you catch the virus is the period when you are at the highest risk of infecting others. If you have been sick, and it has been at least 14 days since you stopped having any lingering symptoms, such as a cough, you should be able to behave normally. However, you should take care around people who may be more vulnerable.</br></br>If you are hospitalized, you will be discharged only after you test negative for the virus over a period of time, and are no longer able to infect others. When leaving the hospital, you may still be advised to isolate yourself for an additional 14 days to ensure you do not put anyone at risk."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is there any chance of not having any symptoms even after getting infected with COVID-19?",
          "answer": "Yes. In fact, most of the people who have tested positive for the virus in Nepal have not reported any symptoms, but have been able to transmit the virus to others. Asymptomatic carriers, as these people are called, are believed to play a major role in transmission of COVID-19 These carriers do not know that they have the virus, and could unknowingly pass it on."
        },
        {
          "question": "If I have no symptoms, do I still need to maintain distance from people with diabetes and hypertension?",
          "answer": "People with diabetes and hypertension, and those who are old fall under the group of people with high risk of developing complications if they get COVID-19, and it is best to be cautious right now. If you go out frequently, or are in situations where you might be exposed to the virus, you should take precautions like wearing a mask around vulnerable groups."

        {
          "question": "As the season is changing, we can see many people suffering from the flu. Therefore, how can we distinguish between common cold/seasonal flu and COVID-19 patients without a lab test?",
          "answer": "Lab test is the only verifiable way to confirm whether the person has COVID-19. To be on the safe side, before they can be tested, we should assume they are infected and maintain physical distancing."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is meant by mild COVID-19 symptoms? And how is it different from common cold and seasonal flu?",
          "answer": "Mild symptoms mean a slight cough and maybe a sore throat. It is not easy to distinguish from other respiratory infections."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why is quarantine 14 days long?",
          "answer": "If you have been infected with COVID-19, it could take as long as 14 days for symptoms to appear. During these 14 days, even if you have no symptoms, you could have a high concentration of viruses in your nose and throat, which can easily spread to others. So this is a precaution to protect others."

        {
          "question": "Is losing sense of smell and taste a symptom of COVID-19?",

        },
        {
          "question": "How deadly is COVID-19?",
          "answer": "Because not everyone is being tested it is difficult to be sure how deadly the infection is. Of the 712 passengers who had the disease on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, 98.5% survived. This was despite the fact that many of these passengers were older people. Infection and fatality rates can vary significantly based on underlying factors, including existing health conditions, as well as access to healthcare."

          "answer": "None is known so far, except respiratory support and oxygen but researchers are working on finding that out. Do not take treatments suggested by friends. If you have a fever, taking paracetamol will make you feel better and drinks containing honey can help reduce the cough. People with symptoms of COVID-19 should drink lots of hot water, tea, juices, and soups."

          "answer": "Although the COVID-19 virus is considered to have originated from animals, it is now spread from people to people. So, vegetarianism is not going to protect you. It is always good to eat a balanced diet containing plenty of vegetables and fruits if possible.  Protein are one of the most essential macronutrients and should be taken adequately. Meat products should be cooked properly and thoroughly if you are not a vegetarian . "
        },
        {
          "question": "Can the virus exist in or on vegetables, fruits, or packaged food?",
          "answer": "There haven’t been studies on this. In theory, small quantities of the virus may survive on the skins of fruits and vegetables and on food packets. As of now, health authorities around the world are advising that this is a small risk. Washing your vegetables and fruits, and washing your hands after handling them should be good enough for precaution."

        {
          "question": "What can we do to sterilize packaged food before use?",
          "answer": "Before using packaged food can be sterilized by heating to inactivate the virus as proteins coagulate in higher temperature. Microwave heating is also a safer alternative but should be heated adequately . Washing hands before eating is a must and food from the container should be transferred to a clean  and dry container. "

        {
          "question": "If a person who has COVID-19 delivers some food items and leaves it outside, if we pick up that food after sometime, what is the chance of its spread?",
          "answer": "The chance of spread is there but it is unlikely you will catch the virus this way if you only pick up the food and don't eat it. If you want to take additional precautions, you could use gloves to handle the food, transfer the contents into a clean container, throw away the packaging, and wash your hands immediately. Take care not to touch your face before washing your hands."

However, the WHO has warned against assuming that someone who has had the virus and produced antibodies is immune.</br></br>Even if people are immune once they recover, there is the question of how long they are immune. This coronavirus is closest to the one that caused SARS, <a href='https://www.wired.com/story/covid-19-immunity/' target='_blank'>where immunity lasted 2-3 years</a>, but immunity to this could also work like the coronavirus that causes the common cold, where immunity only lasts a few months. In short, we don’t know yet, and research is ongoing on this important question.</br></br>A few patients also seem to be suffering from symptoms again after recovery. However, this could also mean that the earlier result was incorrect."

        {
          "question": "Recent news showed that people treated and cured have been found to be COVID-19 positive later. What might be the reason behind that?",
          "answer": "There are reports from some countries, especially South Korea and China of people who fully recovered from the virus testing positive for a second time. This could be because their previous test was a mistake, and they have not cleared the virus from their system yet. Scientists are also exploring the possibility that the virus stayed in their system and was re-activated. This is a new virus, sowe are finding out more each day.</br></br>In other cases this could be because they still had fragments of the defeated virus in their system. Often tests stay positive after someone has recovered because of this. A <a href='https://www.cnnphilippines.com/world/2020/4/18/coronavirus-patients-reinfection.html' target='_blank'>continuing positive PCR</a> may not mean they are still able to infect others."

          "answer": "Stopping travel is a good idea – if everyone stopped moving, the virus would no longer spread from one person to another. Most public health measures are aimed at reducing contact between people whether through travel bans, physical distancing, or lockdowns.</br></br>However, it is impractical to keep up these measures for too long. Testing, contact tracing and isolating those with the virus, or those who have come into contact with them is another strategy, which will need to be undertaken as long as the virus is around."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why is the ‘lockdown’ model considered effective in low-resource countries like Nepal?",
          "answer": "Locking down slows the spread by ensuring less interaction between people. Once workplaces and schools are closed, social events are cancelled, and people are not leaving their homes, the virus is effectively confined to people’s homes and dies out as people recover.</br></br>Low resource countries do not have the capacity to test or many well resourced hospitals with ventilators to treat patients. In 2013 survey we had only roughly 435 ICU beds.  The prevalence rate of covid19 is believed to be 0.03 percent. If there were to be no lock down roughly 10lakh people would be infected which is only 0.03 percent of total population of Nepal. Fatality rate is said to be less than 3 percent so if  only  3 percent of the infected people have severe difficulty in breathing then 30 thousand people would have  severe respiratory distress syndrome  and need ventilators and bed in ICU. These  people who could be easily saved had they been provided with  ventilators and ICU beds would die. These thirty thousand people would be fighting for these 500 beds and that would be scary. It would be a moral dilemma for the doctors to choose the deserving candidate for the ventilators in ICU. However, lockdown can be effective only if it is implemented alongside widespread testing, isolating infected people, and contact tracing to identify others who might have been infected."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is lock down only a temporary solution?",
          "answer": "The lockdown will slow the spread of the infection, but as long as there are some people still infected, the virus can come back and spread fast once the lockdown is lifted. Most countries have seen it as a temporary solution to “flatten the curve” i.e. reduce the rate of infections to a level where the health system can handle it. It also buys everyone much needed time to ramp up testing, as well as find cures or vaccines."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is isolation the best option?",
          "answer": "Yes, isolation helps reduce the spread but there is a difficult balance between keeping people safely isolated and allowing people to work and support themselves. Older people, those with other diseases such as hypertension and diabetes, and people with compromised immune systems are at greater risk of developing complications. They are advised to isolate themselves as much as possible."

Epidemiologists and public health experts around the world are now predicting that COVID-19 is here to stay, and could come in waves --- with projections showing that we might be dealing with it upto 2022 or even into 2024. Of course, if an effective vaccine is found sooner, it will go away much earlier."

          "question": "How much time will it take for the world to completely recover from this pandemic?",
          "answer": "Most experts are now comparing our fight with this pandemic to a marathon. It might not be over as quickly as SARS or Ebola, but come and go in waves. Even if the worst is over, we might have to always be vigilant. Of course, if we find an effective vaccine, that would reduce the time we spend dealing with the pandemic."

          "question": "Is there any chance to shut down this virus?",
          "answer": "A vaccine is our best chance. Otherwise, it has to spread to a large percentage of the population of the world and then if we all become immune, the virus will not have anywhere to go. It will die out naturally."
